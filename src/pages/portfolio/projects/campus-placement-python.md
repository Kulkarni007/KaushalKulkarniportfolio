## Problem
Traditional campus placement systems lack data-driven insights and automation, resulting in inefficient matching between students and employers.

## Solution
Built a comprehensive full-stack placement management system with React frontend and Python/Django backend, including automated resume parsing and predictive analytics.

## Full-Stack Implementation
- **Frontend**: React components for student/company dashboards, Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework APIs for data processing and business logic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for student/company data and placement analytics
- **Integration**: Real-time data flow between frontend and backend systems

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas

## Outcome
- Full-stack application with seamless frontend-backend integration
- Automated resume processing reduces manual screening time by 80%
- Real-time dashboard for placement coordinators
- RESTful API enables third-party integrations
