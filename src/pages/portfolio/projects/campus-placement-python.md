## Problem
Traditional campus placement systems lack data-driven insights and automation, resulting in inefficient matching between students and employers.

## Solution
Built a comprehensive placement management system using Python and Django that automates resume parsing, provides predictive analytics, and generates data-driven placement insights.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Outcome
- Automated resume processing reduces manual screening time by 80%
- Predictive analytics improves placement success rates
- RESTful API enables seamless third-party integrations
- Real-time dashboard for placement coordinators
