## Problem
Need to demonstrate full-stack Python programming skills and object-oriented design principles through a practical delivery management system.

## Solution
Built a comprehensive delivery management system with Python GUI frontend and SQLite backend, showcasing full-stack application development capabilities.

## Full-Stack Implementation
- **Frontend**: Tkinter GUI for desktop application interface with user interactions
- **Backend**: Python server-side logic with object-oriented programming principles
- **Database**: SQLite for data persistence and delivery tracking
- **Integration**: Real-time data flow between GUI interface and database layer

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Tkinter for desktop GUI development
- **Backend**: Python with Object-Oriented Programming
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Data**: JSON for data exchange, DateTime for time management

## Outcome
- Full-stack desktop application with GUI-backend integration
- Demonstrated strong Python programming and OOP skills
- Built functional application with database connectivity
- Showcased system design and full-stack architecture capabilities
